Use terminal mode, put the files in some directory where you want to keep your work.

chdir [drag folder into terminal window] <CR>

You should have the files:
doc2freq.py 		- the Python script
patentsample.txt 	- a text file with many patents in it
				WHAT IS IN THAT FILE?

Make doc2freq execut
	chmod 777 doc2freq

Examine the file patentsample.txt ... Describe what it is

Use document_to_frequency.py to create the frequency table:
python doc2freq.py patentsample.txt

This should create a new file (patentsample.tsv) in the same directory. Look at this file (using TextEdit) and describe what it is.

Use the zipf.r to plot the resulting frequncy data:
Rscript zipf.r patentsample.tsv
